    <h1>Introduction to Web Design</h1>
    <h2>My Self Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm originally from Maryland, outside of Washington DC, but now I'm based in NYC.</p>
    <p>My major is <i>Recorded Music</i>, so naturally I record and play a lot of music.</p>
    <p>I play guitar, piano, bass, and drums, as well as sing.</p>
    <p>My main band is called <b>The Radio Relics</b> where I play drums and sing.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to take this class to learn more about <u>website development</u> so I can hopefully help design websites for my friends who need one!</p>
